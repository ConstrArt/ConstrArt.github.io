First Project: Foldings

![Folding](/assets/img/11.jpg) | ![Folding](/assets/img/yellow.jpg) | ![Folding](/assets/img/simply.jpg) 

This is a series of graphics which I constructed with the postcript programming language.
They are all based on a paralellogram with sides im "relatione divina". This basic shape is scaled, translated and rotated and colored to give the final graphic.

A short describtion of these principles can be found [here](/pdf/folding.pdf).
If you would like to know mare about relatione divina and sectio aurae follow this [link](/pdf/divisioD.pdf).
