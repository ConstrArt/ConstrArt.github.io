In this portfolio I present a series of graphics which I constructed with the Postscript resp. Metafont programming language.

They are all constructed following the same principles. 
A basic geometric shape or pattern is transformed using 
affine transformations and homotheties. The resulting shapes are put together and form 
the complexer final design. The constituating parts and the whole design  are well
proportiante since we take care that they respect the classical rule of "sectio aurea".

A short description of these principles can be found [here](/pdf/folding.pdf).
